# CodeFunDo-2018
CodeFunDo challenge.

The aim of our open source project is to create an offline program, which will be used to maintain a database and keep a track on available resources during times of natural disasters, or in a state of emergency.
User can add, modify,list and show the amount of different resources he/she has anytime, with the program notifying the user aswell when they run low on specific supplies.
The program will also show approximately how long the resources will last and will also maintain daily and weekly consumption of them aswell.
Moreover the program doesn't need internet connection which will most probably be absent during any natural calamities.
